= Rails Parts

Merb parts ported to rails.

As it's initial and a bit experimental implementation please note that API can change (currently it's copied from Merb)

== Usage

Generate part class using rails generator:

  rails generate part Articles index

Add some logic to index method of your part:

    # app/parts/articles_part.rb
    class ArticlesPart < Parts::Base
      def index
        @articles = Article.limit(10)
      end
    end

and to the view file linked to the part

    # app/parts/views/articles_part/index.html.erb
    Articles: <%= @article.map(&:title).join(", ") %>

Now you can render it in the view of any controller with:

    <%= part ArticlesPart => :index %>

You can also attach params that will be available in Part as <code>params</code> hash:

    part ArticlesPart => :index, :limit => 5

    # app/parts/articles_part.rb
    class ArticlesPart < Parts::Base
      def index
        @articles = Article.limit(params[:limit] || 10)
      end
    end
